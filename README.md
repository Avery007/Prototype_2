Design plan
Trying to make a funny and skillful game.
Goal of the game: finding one specific cube and avoid being hit.

Design question: what kind of elements should I add to make the game enjoyable and hard?

Current plan:To increase the difficulty, I added 5 cubes in total. When players approach the right cube, it will disapear.But the false cubes will still exist even if players touch them.
There are 3 balls which will always chase after the player and kill the player if they collides.
If players run into the cylinders they will also be killed.


Questions:
1.Is the game easy or difficult?
 
2.Do you think the speed of the balls suitable?

3.Do you like the effect after the player run into the balls or cylinders? if not how should I display that players lose the game?

4.Should I adjust the camera settings?

5.Is there any bugs occurred when you play?

6.Do you enjoy the game?
