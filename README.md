Design plan
Trying to make a funny and skillful game.
Goal of the game: finding one specific cube and avoid being hit.

Design question: what kind of elements should I add to make the game enjoyable and hard?

Current plan:To increase the difficulty, I added 5 cubes in total. When players approach the right cube, it will disapear.But the false cubes will still exist even if players touch them.
There are 3 balls which will always chase after the player and kill the player if they collides.
If players run into the cylinders they will also be killed.


Questions:

 
1.Do you think the speed of the balls suitable?

2.Should I add more balls or Cylinders?

3.Should I adjust the camera settings?

4.Is there any bugs occurred when you play?

5.Do you enjoy the game?
